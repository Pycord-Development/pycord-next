#[148](https://github.com/pycord/pycord-v3/issues/148): Towncrier

As Pycord v3 grows as a library, a dedicated changelog must be upkept.
Unlike v2, we decided to go down the route of a more advanced tool for v3, that being
to use Towncrier.

Notable changes are:

- Simply adding towncrier config
- Creation of `changes` and `template` directories
