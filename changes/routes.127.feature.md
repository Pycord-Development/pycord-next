#[127](https://github.com/pycord/pycord-v3/issues/127): Routes

Adds a bunch of new routes. This also increases memory efficiency and speed by heavily making use of
`__slots__` where it wasn't before.

A full list of new routes cannot be provided, though you can always parse through the diff and see.

This is not a complete implementation, yet it is the start. Future PRs will be categorized for specific route topics.
